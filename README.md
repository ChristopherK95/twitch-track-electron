## About TwitchTrack
![Application Name Screen Shot][app-screenshot]

TwitchTrack is an application which purpose is to help keeping track on if your favourite Twitch streamers are either live or not.\
<br/>
It does so by: 
- showing a feed of which of your choosen streamers are currently live :heavy_check_mark:
- what category they're currently under :heavy_check_mark:
- what their title is :heavy_check_mark:
- how many viewers they have :heavy_check_mark:
- how long they've been live for :heavy_check_mark:
<br/>
TwitchTrack will also give sound notifications to make sure that you don't miss when a streamer goes live or offline.
